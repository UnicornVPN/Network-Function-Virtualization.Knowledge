>## What is telco cloud?
>Overview
>Telco cloud is a software-defined, highly resilient cloud infrastructure that allows telecommunications service providers (telcos) to add services more quickly, respond faster to changes in network demand, and manage central and decentralized resources more efficiently. It is one of the key foundational components in a successful digital transformation.
>
>Early telco clouds applied virtualization concepts from the datacenter into the networks. With 5G at first, the scope of telco clouds expanded beyond the use of network function virtualization (NFV) and began using newer technologies such as containers and microservices, as well as hybrid cloud architectures. As they are deployed into telco clouds, containers and microservices still have to coexist with older virtualized network functions (VNFs).
